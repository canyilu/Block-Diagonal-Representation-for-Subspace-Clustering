# Block Diagonal Representation (BDR)

In our work [1], we present a unnified theory for the pursuit of the block diagonal matrix structure for subspace clustering (this part is extended from our former work [2]). We also propose the first k-block diagonal regularizer for a direct pursuit of the block diagonal matrix. We then apply it for subpace clustering and name this method as Block Diagonal Representation (BDR).
